## üîí **Protected Routes**  
All routes marked as **Protected** require the user to be authenticated.  
- On successful login, a **JWT access token** will be issued.  
- Pass the token in the request header for protected routes.  
- Unauthorized access attempts will return a **401 - Unauthorized** error.  

### **Example of Authorization Header**  
```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

### üí° **How It Works**  
This API simplifies expense tracking for groups and individuals by providing endpoints to:  
- Add, edit, and view expenses (daily, monthly, or by category).  
- Manage user groups and settlements.  
- View user balances and expense histories.
